## Programming
### Algorithm
An algorithm in programming is a way of showing the logic behind the program in which you describe each step as a clear and unambiguous sequance of instructions. An algorithm should not be written in a programming language, instead it can be written in pseudo code or a flowchart so that the logic of the algorithm can be transferred to any programming language. Algorithms are used to detect any errors in your logic so that you will not have to correct the logic whilst you are programming.
### Programming an Application
There are several steps when programing an application:
#### 1. Getting the idea and requirements of the application
The first step of creating an application is deciding what problem is that you want to fix or finding a client that has a problem that they would be willing to hire you. After that you must decide what the requirements will be to fix that problem or if you have a client you must talk to them to find out what requirements they want for the application. It is possible for these requirement to change later on.
#### 2. Choosing the methodology
The next step is to choose a methodology that will suit the project as this will affect how the company will develop the application and how much the client is involved. There are two types of methodologies: sequential models and iterative Models. Sequential models focus on clear particular steps in an order and not being able to go back to them after they have been completed. Iterative models are focused on creating prototypes of the product and then refining it through feedback from the customer and keep repeating this to get a product that the customer will be happy with.
An example of a sequential methodology would be waterfall which follows these steps:
1. Requirement Analysis
2. System Design
3. Implementation 
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

#### 3. Programing the application
The third step is to program the application which will involve creating an algorithm for the application, choosing a programming language with an appropriate IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and deciding on a coding standard for the whole team so that coding is consistent. After this has been done they will start to code the application using the IDE that was chosen which would supply the programmers with tools like syntax prediction and debugging. If the company is using an iterative methodology you will create prototypes in this step.
#### 4. Testing the application
During the creation of the application you will need to test the application to make sure that there are no bugs and that it is fitting the requirments. Testing can be done through using debugging tools such as being able to create break points so that you can spot errors easier and being able to see values of variables as the code is running. Depending on the methodology this stage can be used to gain feedback from the client from a prototype. Testing the application where there is most likely to be a change in requirements as it will not appear as how the client envisioned. 
#### 5. Documenting the process
Documentation should be happening throughout the entire process so that programmers can use it to see if they are on track with the schedule with a Gantt chart or a burndown chart. It can also be used to reflect on the project after it has been completed so they can improve upon their mistakes. These documents can be used for referencing which can speed up future projects such as taking functions out of the current project. 
#### 6. Publish the application
The final step is to publish the application after it has been completed to a standard that the client is happy with. How the application is published depends on who the client is, if it was designed for a internal system it will only be given to the company that hired you but if there was no client you could start selling your product on the market. 
#### 7. Maintenance
After the application is released the programmers can create a patch that would fix security exploits as they are found or possibly add new features if they are requested by the client. This step is optional depending on what the client requested. 
### Programming Paradigms
#### Procedural Paradigms
Procedural paradigms are a type of programming which has the code executed in a linear sequence. A key feature of procedural paradigms is that you can separate functions from your code into self-contained procedures that will do a certain task as long as it has the correct input and output. Procedures can easily be transferred into another project due to them being self-contained. Usually procedural paradigms are made up of multiple procedures which are called from the main section of code. Procedural paradigms are also known as procedural programming.
#### Object-Orientated Paradigms
Object-orientated paradigms are a way of programming that uses objects which contain properties and can communicate with other objects. Objects can communicate with each other through calling methods of object which act as functions. Classes are templates for a specific object which can be used to make multiple similar objects. Classes can transfer properties to another class or object through inheritance in which a base class (called a parent) will copy over selected properties over to a child. Object-orientated paradigms are also known as object-orientated programming.
#### Event-Driven Paradigms
Event-driven paradigms are a way of programing which focus on events which are broken up into event listeners and event handlers. An event listener is a part of a loop that is constantly checking to see if something has happened, such as a key being pressed or a variable being at a certain value and if it has happened it will call an appropriate event handler. An event handler is code that will be executed when a certain event happens, so for example if the H key was pressed, the program would display the letter h. Event-driven paradigms are also known as event-driven programming.
### Relationship
#### Variables
All three types of paradigms use variables in different ways. Event-driven paradigms use variables to figure out when an event listener should be activated such as an event listener waiting for a variable to get to a certain value before triggering. Object-orientated paradigms use variables in objects and classes to values that can be accessed by each other as long they have the correct access. Procedural paradigms can use procedures to do calculations on variables which will be used later on in the code. 
#### Loops
All three types of paradigms use loops in different ways. Event-driven paradigms use them in event listeners so that they can constantly keep checking if an event happens. Object-orientated paradigms use them in objects to repeat tasks until a condition is met. When procedural paradigms use loops it normally turns them into a procedure so that you can call it instead of having to constainly repeat your code.
#### Functions

All three types of paradigms use functions in different ways. Event-driven paradigms use functions for the event handlers as they will execute a section of code when they are called. Object-orientated paradigms would use functions inside of objects so that objects can do different commands depending on what the program needs. Procedural paradigms would use functions to reduce the amount of code by having repeat code put into a function which can be called as needed.


### Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing bugs inside of a computer program. Bugs are either coding errors or logical errors inside of program that cause it to do unexpected things.

The usual steps in debugging a program is:
1. Discovering the Bug: Whilst a user is using the program, they will accidently encounter a bug. They will then report details about the bug such as what the bug did, the condition that the bug occurred in, the specifications of the pc that the bug occurred and what operating system they were using to the programmer.
2. Recreate the Bug: The programmer would now try to recreate the bug by using the details that was giving to him by the user and once it has reoccurred, they will take a snapshot of the computer which will record the current state of it which will include thing like the variables, file registers.
3. Analysing of the Snapshot: The programmer will search through the snapshot to find any irregular data that may have led to the bug happening.
4. Correcting the bug: Using the knowledge gained from the snapshot, the programmer will correct the bug in the code and will then record the bug and the cause of it into a bug report which can be used to help programmers in later projects.

There are several tools that can help with debugging which can be found as a part of an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Some common debugging tools in an IDE are breakpoints which can stop the program once it has reached a certain line of code so that the user can check the values of variables and can be resumed when the user wants; snapshot, which will record the current state of the computer and program so that it can be viewed later on; and a linter, which will detect when a syntax error has occurred that could possibly stop the code from running and will normally give a suggestion for the correct syntax. Linters can be found for many different programming languages.
