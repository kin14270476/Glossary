## Programming
### Algorithm
Algorithm are a set instruction or rules that must be followed step by step to complete a a task. Algrorithms are mainly used in programming and processing. data One way of showing an algorithm is a flowchart like

There serveral steps in programing application:
### Programing Paradigms
#### Procedural Paradigms
Procedural Paradigms is a way of programing in which it can make decision depending on the situation to go to a different line in the program. It also know as procedural proggramming.
#### Object-Orientated Paradigms
Object-orientated paradigms is a way of programing in which
#### Event-driven Paradigms
Event-driven paradigms is a way of programing in which code is excuted when certain event happen like a keyboard being pressed or after certain amount has passed. It does this by haveing a listener for the event and when it is activated it will call the code and excute it. Event-driven paradigms are mainly used in GUI(graphical user interface)programs as each of the buttons would be set as listener.
