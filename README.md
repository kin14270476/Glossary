## Programming
### Algorithm
Algorithm in programming is a way of showing the logic behind the program in which you describe each step as a clear and unamibiguous intruction.  Algorithm should not be writen in a programing instead it can be writen psudo code or a flowchart so that the logic of the algorithm can be transfered to any programming langauge. Algorithms must have input or otherwise it will only give one answer as calucation will always use the same nubmers. Algorithms can be shown through flowcharts to show their logic. Algorithm are used to help spot any errors in your logic so that it doesn't have to be corrected when programming.

### Programming an Application
There serveral steps in programing application:
#### 1. Getting the idea and requirment of the application
The first step of creating an application is decideing what problem is that you want to fix or finding a client that has a problem that they would be willing to hire you. After that you must decide what the requirment will be to fix that problem or if you have a client you must talk to them to find out what requirment they want for the application. It is possible for these requirment to change later on.

#### 2. Chosing the methodology
The next step is to chose a methodology that will suit the project as this affect how the company will develop the application and how much the client is involved. There are two types of methodologys sequential models and iterative Models. Sequential models focus on clear peticular steps in an order and not being able to go back to them after they have been completed. Iterative models are focused on creating protoypes of the product and then refining it through feedback from the customer and keep repeating this to get a product that the customer will be happy with.
An example of a sequential methodology would be waterfall which follows these steps:
1. Requirement Analysis
2. System Design
3. Implementation 
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

#### 3. Programing the application
The third step is to program the application which will invole creating algorith for the application, chosing a programming language with an approate IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and deciding on a coding standard for the whole team so that coding is constiant. After this has been done they will start to code the application using the IDE that was chosen which would supply the programmers with tools like syntax prediction and debugging. If the company is using a iterative methodology you will create prototypes in this step.

#### 4. Testing the application
During createing the application you will need to test application to make sure that there are no bug and that it is working how programemer thinks it should. Testing can be done through using debugging tools. Depending on the methodology this stage can used gain feedback from the client from a prototype. Testing the application where there most like to be a change in requirments as it will not apear as how the client invision. 

#### 5. Documenating the process
Documenation should be happening through out the entier process so that programmers can use it to see if they are on track with the schedula with gant chart or burndown chart. It can also be used to reflect on the project after it complete so they can improve where did bad. These documents can be used for referncing which can speed up future projects such as taking function out of the current project. 

#### 6. Publish the application
The final step is publish the application after it has been completed to a standard that the client is happy with. How the application is publish depends on who the client is, if they are a private company then it only be given to them but if there was no client it you could start selling your product on the market.   

#### 7. Maintenance
After the application is released the programmers can create a patch that would fix security exploits as they are found or possible add in new feature if they are requested by the client. This step is optional depending on what the client requested. 

### Programing Paradigms
#### Procedural Paradigms
Procedural paradigms is a type of programming which has the code excuted in a linear sequence. A key feature of procedual paradigms is that you can separte functions from your code into self contained procedures that will do a certain task as long as it has the corect input and output. Procedures can easily be transfered into another project due to them being self contained. Ussaly procedural paradigms are made up of mulitple procedures which are called from the main section of code. Procedural paradigms are also know as procedural programming.
#### Object-Orientated Paradigms
Object-orientated paradigms is a way of programming that uses objects which contains properties and can communicate with other objects. Object can communicate with each other through calling methods of object which act as functions. Class are templates for a spefic object which can make muiltple simlar objects. Class can transfer properties to another class or object through inheritance in which a base class called a parent whill copy over selected properties over to a child. Object-orientated paradigms are also know as object-oritated programming.
#### Event-Driven Paradigms
Event-driven paradigms is a way programing which focus on events which is broken up into event listener and event handler. An event listener is a loop that is constantly checking to see if something has happened such as key being pressed or a varible being at certain value and if it has happend it will call an apropate event handler. An event handler is code that will be excuted when a certain event happens so for example if a H key was pressed, program would display the letter h. Event-driven paradigms are also know as event-driven programming.
### Relationship
#### Variables
All three types of paradigms uses variables in different ways. Event-driven uses variables to be used in event lisener as some lisener are waiting for the variable to reach a certain value before triggering. Object-orientated uses variables in object and class to values that can be access by each other as long they have the correct access. Procedural can use procedures to do caluation on variable which will be used later on in the code. 
#### Loops
All three types of paradigms uses loops in different ways. Event-driven use them in event listener so that they can constainly keep checking if an event happens. Object-Orientated use them in object to repeat task until a condition is met. When procedural uses loops it is normaly turn them into a procedure so that you can call it instead of having to create multiple loops.
