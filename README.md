## Programming
### Algorithm
Algorithm in programming is a way of showing the logic behind the program in which you describe each step as a clear and unamibiguous intruction. Algorithm should not be writen in a programing instead it can be writen psudo code or a flowchart so that the logic of the algorithm can be transfered to any programming langauge. Algorithm are used to help spot any errors in your logic so that it doesn't have to be corrected when programming.

Algorithms should have clear and unamiguous intruction so that the logic can be transfered to any programming langunge.

Algorithm are a set instruction or rules that must be followed step by step to complete a a task. Algrorithms are mainly used in programming and processing data. 
Flowcharts are a great way One way of showing an algorithm is a flowchart like

There serveral steps in programing application:
1. Get the requirment of the application 
2. Design the application
3. 
4.

### Programing Paradigms
#### Procedural Paradigms
Procedural Paradigms is a way of programing in which it can make decision depending on the situation to go to a different line in the program. It also know as procedural proggramming.
#### Object-Orientated Paradigms
Object-orientated paradigms is a way of programing in which code stored inside of object which can be call muiltple times. The a section of code in object is called a method. These object will have properties attached to them which effect how they act. To creating a object requires a class which has proerties 
#### Event-driven Paradigms
Event-driven paradigms is a way of programing in which code is excuted when certain event happen like a keyboard being pressed or after certain amount has passed. It does this by haveing a listener for the event and when it is activated it will call a event handler which will  function and excute it. Event-driven paradigms are mainly used in GUI(graphical user interface)programs as each of the buttons would be set as listener.
