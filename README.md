## Programming
### Algorithm
Algorithm in programming is a way of showing the logic behind the program in which you describe each step as a clear and unamibiguous intruction. Algorithm should not be writen in a programing instead it can be writen psudo code or a flowchart so that the logic of the algorithm can be transfered to any programming langauge. Algorithm are used to help spot any errors in your logic so that it doesn't have to be corrected when programming.

Algorithms should have clear and unamiguous intruction so that the logic can be transfered to any programming langunge.

Algorithm are a set instruction or rules that must be followed step by step to complete a a task. Algrorithms are mainly used in programming and processing data. 
Flowcharts are a great way One way of showing an algorithm is a flowchart like

There serveral steps in programing application:
1. Get the requirment of the application 
2. Design the application
3.

### Programing Paradigms
#### Procedural Paradigms
Procedural paradigms is a type of programming which has the code excuted in a linear sequence. A key feature of procedual paradigms is that you can separte functions from your code into self contained procedures that will do a certain task as long as it has the corect input and output. Procedures can easily be transfered into another project due to them being self contained. Ussaly procedural paradigms are made up of mulitple procedures which are called from the main section of code. Procedural paradigms are also know as procedural programming.
#### Object-Orientated Paradigms
Object-orientated paradigms is a way of programming that uses objects which contains properties and can communicate with other objects. Object can communicate with each other through calling methods of object which act as functions. Class are templates for a spefic object which can make muiltple simlar objects. Class can transfer properties to another class or object through inheritance in which a base class called a parent whill copy over selected properties over to a child. Object-orientated paradigms are also know as object-oritated programming.
#### Event-Driven Paradigms
Event-driven paradigms is a way programing which focus on events which is broken up into event listener and event handler. An event listener is a loop that is constantly checking to see if something has happened such as key being pressed or a varible being at certain value and if it has happend it will call an apropate event handler. An event handler is code that will be excuted when a certain event happens so for example if a H key was pressed, program would display the letter h. Event-driven paradigms are also know as event-driven programming.
### Relationship
#### Variables
All three types of paradigms uses variables in different ways. Event-driven uses variables to be used in event lisener as some lisener are waiting for the variable to reach a certain value before triggering. Object-orientated uses variables in object and class to values that can be access by each other as long they have the correct access. Procedural can use procedures to do caluation on variable which will be used later on in the code. 
#### Loops
All three types of paradigms uses loops in different ways. Event-driven use them in event listener so that they can constainly keep checking if an event happens. Object-Orientated use them in object to repeat task until a condition is met. When procedural uses loops it is normaly turn them into a procedure so that you can call it instead of having to create multiple loops.
